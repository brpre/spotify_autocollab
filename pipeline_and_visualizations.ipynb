    "# Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview \n",
    "Given a Spotify username, we will request a user's public playlists from the Spotify API and aggregate them into a dataframe of [audio features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-audio-features) which represent certain attributes of each track. We will then collect data of the same form for each of this user's Spotify friends (users that this user is \"following\"), and aggregate the friend data into a weighted source for recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "After authenticating with the API, we can see a lot of public data on each user. We can get all of their public playlists, retrieve the tracks from each playlist, and get audio features for the tracks (this last step is done in batches of 50 tracks at a time). \n",
    "\n",
    "For each track, we can obtain:\n",
    "- 'acousticness'\n",
    "- 'danceability'\n",
    "- 'energy'\n",
    "- 'instrumentalness'\n",
    "- 'liveness'\n",
    "- 'loudness'\n",
    "- 'speechiness'\n",
    "- 'tempo'\n",
    "- 'valence'\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have attributes like the track's title, artist, and unique Spotify URI, but the audio features are the attributes that will be useful for training a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our expectation is that songs with similar audio features are similar enough for a user who likes one to enjoy the other(s). This is why we intend to use k-nearest neighbors, but more on that later. This audio feature data is essential to make song recommendations becuase it is the only set of numerical features that we have from the Spotify API, so it's the only way to meaningfully conceptualize distance between songs in space. Spotify has its own endpoint for recommendations that takes min, max, and target audio features as attributes, so we're hoping that means we're headed in the right direction when implementing our own audio-feature-based recommender.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify analysis, each audio feature will have its own column in our output DataFrame.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"completed dataframe screenshot upload filepath\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will accomplish this task with four functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_user_playlist_data(username)`\n",
    "    - returns json list of simplified playlist objects from Spotify API\n",
    "- `get_track_ids(req_data_json)`\n",
    "    - gets a list of track IDs from the given list of playlist objects, track IDs will be used to request audio feature data\n",
    "- `get_audio_features(user_tracks)`\n",
    "    - given a list of track IDs, requests audio features for tracks in batches of 50 and adds track features as entries to dataframe\n",
    "- `clean_user_af_df(audio_features_df)`\n",
    "    - cleans given dataframe by removing redundant columns and those that are not useful for our model, retaining track ID and audio features\n",
    "\n",
    "All four functions are wrapped into one convenience function for ease of calling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_user_audio_features(username)`\n",
    "    - wraps the ETL process in one conveninence function, the result of which is a clean dataframe of audio features for tracks found in this user's public playlists\n",
    "    \n",
    "As well as one web scraping script:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scrape list of games:** use `get_url()` and `clean_top_games()` in a loop to collect n pages of top games (100 * n games), populating a DataFrame `df_game`\n",
    "- **Get meta data per game:** loop through each row of `df_game`, query and process the individual game's webpage via `get_url()` and `clean_game_meta()` using the previously collected url and append the remaining features to `df_game`"
